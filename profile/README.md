## Hi!

Hi there! We're Project: Andromeda. We're a group of two developers, [AstralFennex](https://www.github.com/AstralFennex) and [XenithMusic (aka cookiiq)](https://www.github.com/AstralFennex).
We're working on the following projects, in the following order:
- [Paranoia (a kernel)](https://www.github.com/XenithMusic/Paranoia) (temporarily on the XenithMusic personal repository)
- AstraVeil Light (a window manager) (NO REPO)
- [AstraVeil (a desktop environment)](https://www.github.com/Project-Andromeda/AstraVeil)
- Celestle OS (an operating system based on the 3 previous elements) (NO REPO)

We will also be maintaining:
- The `.kli` file format, an object file format designed to make extending kernel behavior easier. (NO DOCUMENTATION)
- A program like X11 for the Paranoia kernel. (NO REPO)

Right now, only the kernel, and `.kli` file format, are being worked on. All of the other elements depend on these first, so these must come first.
